- Install **FanaLab** not just the driver. Pygame will not recognize the fanatec hardware otherwise.
- Installed Miniconda (fanatec environment)
- (pypi) *carla* package requires python==3.8 
    #(conda create -n fanatec python==3.8)
- Packages (specific): pygame, numpy / scikit-learn






Questions:
- CARLA UE4 vs UE5
    # UE5 has AI-integration, updated python packages, better graphics and physics rendering
- Gfx requirements
    # Integration of AI vs graphics rendering
- Cloud or local AI (nemotron) model?
    # Which model to run?
